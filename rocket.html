        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p> I developed this sounding rocket in collaboration with 
        a student team at the University of Alberta whose sole mission
        is to provide students with the opportunity to explore rocket engineering.
        I joined the team shortly after its inception and quickly became the 
        lead designer of the rocket. The learning curve was a challenge. Rather,
        it was a challenge I was willing to accept.
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extracurricular student team project</li>
        <li>Design, build, test, and launch a solid-fuel 
        rocket to reach an altitude of 3040 +/- 10 m </li>
        <li>Built for the annual Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition in Los Cruces, New Mexico</li>
        <li>This project is the first step towards liquid fuel rocket development</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our objective was to develop a solid fuel rocket to reach
    an altitude of 3040 m, break the sound barrier, and cost less than
    $5000 to build.</p> 

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>To successfully design a rocket capable of attaining an apogee of 3040 ± 10 m, 
            is no easy feat. This was undoubtably a team effort. 
            I will, to the best of my ability, describe how my team and I tackled this 
            project and the role I played in bringing this project to completion. 
            My discussion of the project will highlight the following key points:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How we divided the project into sub problems</li>
            <li>What these sub problems were</li>
            <li>The solutions our team developed to answer each sub problem</li>
            <li>The lessons I learned during this project</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Conceptual design</h3>
        <p>
            The key to a project of this scale is to divide it into smaller, more 
            manageable sub problems. We must first describe what the solution looks
            like before we can identify the sub problems in the solution process. 
            This is very similar to the way differential equations are solved in 
            mathematics. We begin by understanding the general form of the solution 
            and then work backwards to determine the steps required to arrive at our 
            final solution. Now for a rocket, this means estimating the vehicle’s 
            geometry, the approximate mass of each subsystem, their respective 
            locations inside the rocket, and the expectations of the planned mission. 
            Three concept designs were developed, based on the collective flight 
            experience of the rocketry community, rules of thumb, and open source 
            software. The best concept was then chosen based on a decision matrix 
            that ranked each design on the following factors: mass, cost, and 
            complexity.
        </p>

        <p>With the general solution now known, our team then divided the subsystems 
            of the rocket into sub problems. The most notable sub problems our team 
            encountered during the detailed design phase of the project were as 
            follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The trajectory problem: Accurate flight path and conditions estimation</li>
            <li>The loads estimation problem: Accurate axial, shear, and moment force
                 estimation</li>
            <li>The optimization problem: how do we design the perfect rocket for 
                our flight conditions?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The trajectory problem</h3>

        <p>The ability to predict the trajectory of the rocket with accuracy and 
            precision, is critical to mission success. Without reliable trajectory
            data, our team could not safely design the rocket’s structure or guarantee
            that our rocket would deliver the payload to its required altitude. To 
            fully convey the magnitude of this problem, I will first provide some 
            background information on trajectory prediction and then describe how our 
            team was able to overcome this challenge.
        </p>

        <p>With this understood, our next step was to figure out how implement this 
            into a simulation. I studied the physics behind this problem until I had
            gathered enough information to at least comprehend the solution procedure
            required for such a simulation. The solution procedure for a 6 degree 
            of freedom trajectory simulation is as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Initialize the rocket in a known position and orientation in time t = 0</li>
            <li>Compute the local wind velocity and other atmospheric conditions</li>
            <li>Compute the aerodynamic forces and moments affecting the rocket </li>
            <li>Compute the effects of the motor thrust and gravity on the rocket</li>
            <li>Compute the mass and moments of inertia of the rocket and from these 
            the linear and angular accelerations of the rocket</li>
            <li>Numerically integrate the acceleration equations to obtain
            velocities, positions, and orientations during time step Δt</li>
            <li>Update current time to t = t + Δt</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 1-7 until the entire trajectory has been plotted 
            (read: the rocket has landed) </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Although we understood the simulation procedure, our team was ill-equipped
        at the time to implement such a thing into a full software package. 
        Thankfully, we live in an age where open source software is in abundance. 
        In 2009 Sampo Niskanen, an MSc. candidate attending Helsinki University of 
        Technology, completed his MSc. thesis titled “Development of an Open Source 
        model rocket simulation software”. What his work translated to, was a complete
        software package wherein a rocket could be designed, and its trajectory 
        simulated, accounting for the aforementioned factors. The software Niskanen 
        developed was aptly named OpenRocket and was immediately implemented into our 
        design cycle. Upon discovery of this open source software, we studied 
        Niskanen’s thesis which doubled as documentation describing how the software
        functioned. Once we completely understood the assumptions and limitations of
        the software, our team was finally able to compute the necessary parameters
        for further design work involving loads estimation and design optimization. 
        </p>

        <h3>The load estimation problem</h3>

        <p>Coming soon!</p>



        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
        <p>I figured out how to determine the structural loads on a
        rocket. How to predict the static stability of a rocket. I 
        learned what the most appropriate materials and manufacturing 
        methods were and relayed that to my team.
        
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned how to compute aerodynamic coefficients using the Barrowman equations</li>
                <li>I learned how to predict the external loads on a rocket</li>
                <li>Careful design of aluminum components reduces manufacturing costs and lead times</li>
                <li>Fiber reinforced 3D printed components enable greater design felxibility</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Future development</h2>
        <p> This rocket is only the beginning. A solid fuel rocket 
        allowed my team to get comfortable with rocket vehicle design
        and the physics underlying rocket flight. I intend to guide my team
        through liquid fuel engine development in the very near future. The future
        of spaceflight depends on the design of more effiecient and more powerful
        engines. The sooner we can get students involved, the sooner they can make
        a huge impact in industry.
