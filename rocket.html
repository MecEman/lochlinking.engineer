        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>Note: This article is incomplete. The article will be completed 
        by 10:00 am Saturday</h3>
        <p> I developed this sounding rocket in collaboration with 
        a student team at the University of Alberta whose sole mission
        is to provide students with the opportunity to explore rocket engineering.
        I joined the team shortly after its inception and quickly became the 
        lead designer of the rocket. The learning curve was a challenge. Rather,
        it was a challenge I was willing to accept.
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extracurricular student team project</li>
        <li>Designed a rocket from the ground up</li>
        <li>Became familiar with industry standard analysis techniques</li>
        <li>Expanded my knowledge outside of my discipline</li>
        <li>Used as a stepping stone in liquid fuel rocket development</li>
        <li>Improved my machining skills and broadened my manufacturing knowledge</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our objective was to develop a solid fuel rocket to reach
    an altitude of 3040 m, break the sound barrier, and cost less than
    $5000 to build.</p> 

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>The development of this rocket came with a learning curve 
        steeper than anything I had previously encountered in my life.
        Our team started from square one. Our first year was spent 
        building the foundational knowledge needed to build a rocket
        and learning the appropriate analysis techniques. One of the 
        most difficult challenges for our team to overcome was the 
        estimation of external loads. Once we understood the physics 
        behind the rocket

        <ul>
            <li>Loads estimation was the hardest part of rocket development</li>
            <li>The recovery system was the most difficult system to develop</li>
            <li>Open source software has made trajectory prediction much simpler</li>
            <li>CNC machining is expensive for one off parts and can be avoided with appropriate design decisions</li>
        </ul>
        
        </p>
        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
        <p>I figured out how to determine the structural loads on a
        rocket. How to predict the static stability of a rocket. I 
        learned what the most appropriate materials and manufacturing 
        methods were and relayed that to my team.
        
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned how to compute aerodynamic coefficients using the Barrowman equations</li>
                <li>I learned how to predict the external loads on a rocket</li>
                <li>Careful design of aluminum components reduces manufacturing costs and lead times</li>
                <li>Fiber reinforced 3D printed components enable greater design felxibility</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Future development</h2>
        <p> This rocket is only the beginning. A solid fuel rocket 
        allowed my team to get comfortable with rocket vehicle design
        and the physics underlying rocket flight. I intend to guide my team
        through liquid fuel engine development in the very near future. The future
        of spaceflight depends on the design of more effiecient and more powerful
        engines. The sooner we can get students involved, the sooner they can make
        a huge impact in industry.
