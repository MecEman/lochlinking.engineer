        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p> I partnered with an Albertan aerospace manufacturer for my
        capstone project. My objective was to develop a feasible
        VTOL system for a fixed wing drone. This was a challenging 
        project that tested my understanding of rotorcraft aerodynamics,
        strength of materials, composite materials, and finite element analysis.
        The result was a system that was lightweight, stiff, and simple to 
        both manufacture and assemble.
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Undergraduate captstone project</li>
        <li>Developed a 5 kg VTOL system to lift a 60 kg drone</li>
        <li>Expanded my knowledge of finite element analysis</li>
        <li>A fantastic opportunity to work with composites</li>
        <li>Designed aerodynamic components, optimized for 3D printing</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p> Several concepts were developed. It was discovered that 
        8 smaller brushless DC motors in a coaxial configuration could 
        provide more thrust than four larger motors yet weigh less. Having
        8 motors instead of 4 adds an element of redundancy into the system.
        The structure of the VTOL was chosen to be a simple rectangular profile,
        water jet cut from aluminum sheet and folded into shape. This design
        was lightweight, inexpensive, and simple. I designed a streamlined
        wind shroud for the VTOL system, taking advantage of the capabilities
        of 3D printing.

        <ul>
        <li>Sized and selected off the shelf components to reduce system costs</li>
        <li>Performed topology optimization to meet mass specifications</li>
        <li>Ensured the final system was easy to manufacture and assemble</li>
        <li>Used my understanding of the strength of materials to design an ultralight structure</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>

        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water jet cutting is an affordable way to easily improve manufacturability</li>
                <li>Composites are a challenge to analyze but offer unparalleled mechanical properties</li>
                <li>Off the shelf components greatly reduce overall system cost</li>
                <li>FEA is a powerful tool when verification and validation are correctly performed</li>
                <li>3D printing allows design flexibility unlike any traditional processes</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Future development</h2>
        <p>The lessons learned through this project and the analysis
        techniques employed will prove to be valuable in future 
        projects. I intend to further refine my understanding of 
        FEA best practices and their applications in structural design
        involving composite materials.
